# iris_kmean_classification

This is a machine learning algorithm using K-nearest neighbor classification to classify species of the Iris flower. The aim is to be able to predict to which specie a flower can belong to if we get new information from outside the training dataset.

This method of classification is widely used in many disciplines to predict to which family, or class, dependant variables can belong to.
